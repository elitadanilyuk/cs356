Peer Review:

My team consisted of myself, Elita Danilyuk, Greyson Sequino, and Jean-Marc Ruffalo-Burgat. We decided to split the team work based on the 3 parts due for the assignment. Each team member put in the effort to complete their sections. We all did equal work and I would give 100% effort to each of us.

We worked well together as a team.
